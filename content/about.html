<h3>About $BURN-E</h3>
<p><strong>$BURN-E</strong> is an innovative deflationary token that <em>burns itself</em>. Each time a small amount of $BURN-E is used, a portion is sent to the fire and removed from circulation forever—reducing supply and increasing scarcity.</p>

<h4>How it works with PlayDeFi</h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Burned Forever:</strong> The most significant portion is permanently removed.</li>
  <li><strong>Treasury:</strong> A portion goes into the project treasury (community fund).</li>
  <li><strong>Burn & Reward:</strong> 75% of the treasury is burned; 25% funds a weekly drawing for active dApp users.</li>
</ol>

<p>The project began with the support of <strong>OG Cat NFT holders</strong>, who helped bootstrap PlayDeFi and continue earning rewards. <strong>$BURN-E Burner NFT</strong> holders participate in community decisions about burns, rewards, and growth.</p>

<p><strong>PlayDeFi</strong> is the engine, <strong>Burner NFTs</strong> are the ignition, and <strong>$BURN-E</strong> is the fuel. Every event entry contributes to burning tokens, strengthening the ecosystem, and creating opportunities via ongoing rewards. The more people participate, the faster the supply decreases.</p>

<p><em>At its core, $BURN-E is about community, action, and purpose—where gaming, winning, and growth are interconnected.</em></p>

<p><strong>Motto:</strong> Play. Burn. Win. Build.</p>
