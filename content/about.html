<h3>(About $BURN-E)</h3>
<p>$BURN-E is an exciting and innovative crypto token designed to do something most tokens don't: it intentionally burns itself. Each time a small amount of $BURN-E is used, a portion of it is sent to the fire, disappearing forever. This process reduces the total supply of tokens, making the remaining ones rarer and more valuable.</p>
<p>When participants engage in events on PlayDeFi, a small amount of $BURN-E is used. This amount is divided into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Burned Forever</strong>: The most significant portion is permanently removed from circulation.</li>
<li><strong>Treasury</strong>: A portion goes into the project treasury, which serves as our community fund.</li>
<li><strong>Burn and Reward</strong>: Seventy-five percent of the treasury is burned, while the remaining twenty-five percent is allocated to fund a weekly drawing for active members using the dApp.</li>
</ol>
<p>The project was initially supported by the OG Cat NFT holders, who played a crucial role in the early days of PlayDeFi and continue to earn rewards. Additionally, $BURN-E burner NFT holders have a say in community decisions regarding burns, rewards, and the project's overall growth.</p>
<p>Together, PlayDeFi acts as the engine, the Burner NFTs serve as the spark, and $BURN-E itself is the fuel that keeps everything moving. Each entry into a PlayDeFi event contributes to burning more tokens, strengthening the ecosystem, and creating real opportunities for the community through ongoing rewards. The more people participate, the faster the token supply decreases, resulting in a greater impact.</p>
<p>At its core, $BURN-E is all about community, action, and purposeâ€”a system where gaming, winning, and growth are interconnected.</p>
