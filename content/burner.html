<h3>($BURN-E Burner NFT)</h3>
<p>The $BURN-E Burner NFT serves as a non-transferable lifetime membership to the PlayDeFi dApp on the $BURN-E blockchain. Each NFT can be purchased for $10.00 in $BURN-E tokens, directly through the PlayDeFi dApp.</p>
<p>Every purchase contributes to burning supply, supporting real-world causes, and provides access to exclusive PlayDeFi fundraising events and giveaways.</p>
<h4>How Each Purchase Is Used:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>10%</strong> → Rewards original OG Cat NFT Holders, recognizing the early supporters of the PlayDeFi project.</li>
  <li><strong>90%</strong> → Burned Forever, which means these tokens are instantly destroyed and permanently removed from the total supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every $BURN-E Burner NFT purchase makes $BURN-E rarer and increases its value over time.</p>
<h4>How It Works:</h4>
<p>To participate in PlayDeFi events, you must hold at least one $BURN-E Burner NFT. Each NFT grants one valid entry per event. You can participate as many times as you have NFTs in your wallet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 NFT = 1 Entry</li>
  <li>2 NFTs = 2 Entries</li>
  <li>3 NFTs = 3 Entries</li>
</ul>
<p>Your $BURN-E Burner NFTs never expire; they remain valid for life. You only need additional NFTs if you want multiple entries in the same event.</p>
<h4>The Burn System:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PlayDeFi = The Engine</strong></li>
  <li><strong>$BURN-E Burner NFT = The Ignition</strong></li>
  <li><strong>$BURN-E = The Fuel</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Participation is the fire that drives the system. Every event you enter contributes to another burn. The more people engage, the faster the supply decreases, creating a lasting impact for both the ecosystem and real-world charities.</p>
<h4>Call to Action:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Participate in the events</li>
  <li>Build the Discord community</li>
  <li>Invite your friends to join the movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, we Play. Burn. Build.</p>
