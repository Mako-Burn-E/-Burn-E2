<h3>How $BURN-E Benefits from PlayDeFi Integration</h3>

<h4>Fundraiser Event Format</h4>
<p>Each event (Stock or Custom) requires USDC + $BURN-E for entry. Participants contribute a fixed USDC amount plus <strong>10%</strong> of that amount in $BURN-E.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> A $10.00 USDC entry also requires $1.00 worth of $BURN-E.</p>
