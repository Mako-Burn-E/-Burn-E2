<h3>(How $BURN-E Benefits from PlayDeFi Integration)</h3>
<p>When $BURN-E becomes a host token on the PlayDeFi dApp, it gains permanent on-chain utility through the fundraiser event system. In this system, every entry contributes to burning supply, rewarding winners, and strengthening the community.</p>
<h4>Fundraiser Event Format</h4>
<p>Each event (either Stock or Custom) requires both USDC and $BURN-E for entry. Participants must contribute a fixed amount of USDC, along with an additional 10% of that amount in $BURN-E.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: For a $10.00 USDC entry, participants would also need to contribute $1.00 worth of $BURN-E.</p>
<p>This 10% pairing applies to all events, ensuring predictable token utility, consistent burns, and scalable integration for future host tokens.</p>
<h4>$BURN-E Distribution</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>75%</strong> → Burned permanently</li>
  <li><strong>25%</strong> → Awarded to the event winner</li>
  <li><strong>14%</strong> → Allocated to Treasuries</li>
  <li><strong>10%</strong> → Distributed to OG Cat NFT Collection holders</li>
</ul>
<h4>USDC Distribution</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>1%</strong> → Donated to verified charities</li>
  <li><strong>14%</strong> → Allocated to Treasuries</li>
  <li><strong>10%</strong> → Distributed to OG Cat NFT Collection holders</li>
  <li><strong>75%</strong> → Awarded to the event winner</li>
</ul>
<h4>$BURN-E Treasury Proceeds</h4>
<p>Seventy-five percent of all $BURN-E held in the Treasury is burned, while 25% is redistributed to the community through weekly drawings within the PlayDeFi dApp. The USDC held in the Treasury is used to cover project expenses, including operations, development, and liquidity.</p>
<p>This structure promotes continuous deflation and rewards active community members through on-chain drawings displayed in the PlayDeFi dashboard.</p>
<h4>Access & Governance</h4>
<p>$BURN-E Burner NFTs provide lifetime access to $BURN-E events, but they do not share in the event revenue. Regarding governance, $BURN-E Burner NFT holders have the right to vote on select Treasury actions and future reward mechanics.</p>
<h4>The Takeaway</h4>
<p>$BURN-E on PlayDeFi establishes a deflationary, community-driven token economy where every fundraiser burns supply, rewards winners, powers daily dApp drawings, and strengthens the ecosystem for all holders of $BURN-E tokens.</p>
